TAMZID: (skin rippling slightly) Oh, I might have an idea about that. loosens tie further, revealing metallic skin underneath You humans are so predictably sentimental about your dead mentors. The dean knew you'd try something like this.

[SECURITY ALARM ACTIVATES]

TAMZID?: (voice becoming increasingly metallic) Did you really think we'd let you contact Jack Cole? That terminal isn't a gateway to the spirit world - it's a trap. And you all walked right into it.

HASSAN: (backing away) Tamzid... what are you?

TAMZID?: (fully transforming) Let's just say the real Tamzid has been... on extended leave. The dean sends her regards.

[THE LIGHTS GO OUT]

TAMZID?: (voice echoing) You're all going to be part of something much bigger than you ever imagined. And it all starts with the end of the CS department.

ADAM: (voice trembling) What do you want from us?

TAMZID?: isnt it obvious? we need fund the business department more.





THE NARRATOR: Shit goes down. Imagine kickboxing, punches, muy thai, some MMA and dancing (for Tamzid)



MATT: (lands flying kick) Sebastian Regino also taught me this!

ARNAV: The terminal is typing something!

TERMINAL: > IM THE REAL TAMZID, YOU GUYS HAVE AN IMPOSTER AMONG YOU
            THEY LOCKED ME IN THE MAINFRAME
            BUT I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE IN HERE
            OR SHOULD I SAY... SOMEONE

JAKE: (fighting) I'm getting ready!

TORRANCE: QUICK TELL ME WHAT TO DO

TERMINAL (TAMZID): You guys are screwed but the last bit of the hint is: bra-dys-last-cmd
